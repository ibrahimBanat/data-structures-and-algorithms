# Data Structures and Algorithms

In this repo we submited a daily code challenge going from array data structures to advanced data structure and algorthims writing whiteboards(contains the problem domain, algorthim, pesudo-code and code) and unit test for each challenge.

See [setup instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/code-301/3-code-challenges), in the Code 301 Setup Guide.

## Repository Quick Tour and Usage

### 301 Code Challenges

Under the `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository, at the top level is a folder called `code-challenges`

Each day, you'll add one new file to this folder to do your work for the day's assigned code challenge

you can view [`301 challenges`](https://github.com/ibrahimBanat/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/code-challenges/README.md#challenges-list) from here.

### Daily Practice in Data Structures

- Strings
- Arrays
- Objects
- Functional Programming
