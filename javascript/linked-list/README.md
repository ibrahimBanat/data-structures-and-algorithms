# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

# Singly Linked List

Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory.

## Challenge

In this challenge, we wrote the implementation, testing and semantci error handling for singly linked list using ES6 clases.

## Approach & Efficiency

the approach is navigation forward only

- Space : O(1)
- Time : O(n)

## API

- `chcekForInput()`: this method is to handle check if the input is not `undefined` or infinity.
- `addNewHead()` : this method creates a new head if not exist, otherwise it's append a new head to the begining of the linked list.
- `includes()`: this method compare input value if it's exist in linked list.
- `toString()`: return a string visiulizing the linked list shape.
